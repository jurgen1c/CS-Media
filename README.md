> Ruby's on Rails Crowd Sourced Media Website Project 

## Concept
>  The concept behind this project is to combat the slew of fake news nad general mistrust they have created in the publlic eye. To achieve this my app require any user to add atleast one source, though more can be added, to justify their articles content, this can be a video, audio or pdf. Further more users can create reviews for articles either verifying whats is stated or exposeing it as misinformation, all reviews can have attached files as well. Finally user may vote for articles with good verified content to promote a more secure article heirarchy. 
## Usage

- This project intends to practice my skills building a full working MVP;
- Prepare data architecture documentation;
- Working with deployment to Heroku.
- Working Amazon S3 services<br>
